This is a sample text file that will be used to test the HYDRA encryption system.

HYDRA is a custom encryption algorithm that features:

1. Adaptive rounds based on data complexity
2. JIT acceleration for optimal performance
3. Metadata-enhanced format for reliable decryption
4. Parallel processing for large data files

This implementation demonstrates how a small design change (adding metadata)
can transform an unreliable algorithm into a reliable one while maintaining
the security benefits of variable-round encryption.

With the improved unified implementation, HYDRA offers:
- 100% reliable decryption
- High performance with JIT compilation
- Multi-threaded processing for large files
- Password-based key derivation with PBKDF2
