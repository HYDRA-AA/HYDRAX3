# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The HYDRA encryption project takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for the vulnerability.
2. Email your findings to [security@example.com] (replace with actual contact when available).
3. Include as much information as possible about the vulnerability:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested mitigation or fix (if any)
4. Allow time for the vulnerability to be addressed before any public disclosure.

## Security Expectations

HYDRA is currently an experimental encryption system and has not undergone comprehensive security analysis. Please note:

- The codebase is under active development and may contain vulnerabilities
- Security audits are not yet complete
- The algorithm design is still evolving based on feedback and analysis

## Security Measures

The project employs several security practices:

- All reported vulnerabilities will be investigated promptly
- Security updates will be clearly marked in release notes
- A disclosure timeline will be agreed upon with reporters
- Credit will be given to vulnerability reporters (unless anonymity is requested)

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

Currently, all versions are considered experimental and should not be used in production environments.

## Security Updates

Security updates will be communicated through:

- GitHub security advisories
- Release notes
- The project's README file

## Cryptographic Validation

The HYDRA project encourages:

- Independent cryptanalysis of the algorithm
- Peer review of the implementation
- Formal security proofs and analysis
- Test vector validation

If you have performed cryptanalysis on HYDRA, we welcome your findings through the above reporting channels or through academic publication.
