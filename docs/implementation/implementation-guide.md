# HYDRA Encryption Implementation Guide

This guide provides instructions for integrating and using the HYDRA encryption algorithm in your projects.

## Important Security Notice

**HYDRA is an experimental encryption algorithm** that has not undergone sufficient cryptanalysis to be considered secure for production use. Do not use this for sensitive data until the algorithm has received extensive review from the cryptographic community.

## Installation

### From Source

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hydra-encryption.git
   cd hydra-encryption
   ```

2. Install the package:
   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```

### Development Installation

For development, install with additional dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Basic Usage

### Encrypting and Decrypting Data

```python
from hydra.core import HydraCipher

# Create a key (must be 32 or 64 bytes)
key = bytes.fromhex("000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f101112131415161718191a1b1c1d1e1f")  # 32-byte/256-bit key

# Initialize the cipher
cipher = HydraCipher(key)

# Encrypt data
plaintext = b"This is a secret message."
ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(plaintext)

# Decrypt data
decrypted = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext)
assert decrypted == plaintext
```

### Generating Secure Keys

It's crucial to use cryptographically secure random keys. Here's how to generate them:

```python
import os

# Generate a 256-bit (32-byte) key
key_256 = os.urandom(32)

# Generate a 512-bit (64-byte) key
key_512 = os.urandom(64)
```

## Advanced Usage

### Working with Large Files

For large files, you should process the data in chunks to avoid loading everything into memory:

```python
from hydra.core import HydraCipher
import os

def encrypt_file(input_path, output_path, key):
    cipher = HydraCipher(key)
    
    # Read and encrypt in chunks
    chunk_size = 1024 * 1024  # 1 MB chunks
    with open(input_path, 'rb') as in_file, open(output_path, 'wb') as out_file:
        while True:
            chunk = in_file.read(chunk_size)
            if not chunk:
                break
            
            encrypted_chunk = cipher.encrypt(chunk)
            out_file.write(encrypted_chunk)

def decrypt_file(input_path, output_path, key):
    cipher = HydraCipher(key)
    
    # Process in chunks that are multiples of 64 bytes (the block size)
    chunk_size = 1024 * 1024  # 1 MB chunks (must be a multiple of 64)
    with open(input_path, 'rb') as in_file, open(output_path, 'wb') as out_file:
        while True:
            chunk = in_file.read(chunk_size)
            if not chunk:
                break
            
            decrypted_chunk = cipher.decrypt(chunk)
            out_file.write(decrypted_chunk)
```

### Custom Parameters

The reference implementation uses default parameters. For advanced users who want to customize the algorithm:

```python
class CustomHydraCipher(HydraCipher):
    # Customize the number of rounds
    MIN_ROUNDS = 20  # Increase from default 16
    MAX_ROUNDS = 28  # Increase from default 24
    
    # Customize the number of S-boxes
    NUM_S_BOXES = 32  # Increase from default 16
```

## Performance Considerations

HYDRA is designed for security rather than performance. Keep these considerations in mind:

1. **Block Size**: HYDRA operates on 64-byte (512-bit) blocks, which is larger than most encryption algorithms.

2. **Adaptive Rounds**: The algorithm may use a variable number of rounds based on data complexity, which means encryption time can vary.

3. **Memory Usage**: The hyperdimensional state structure and complex operations require more memory than simpler algorithms.

4. **Hardware Acceleration**: Unlike established algorithms like AES, HYDRA does not have hardware acceleration support in current processors.

## Security Considerations

### Key Management

Proper key management is critical:

1. **Generate Strong Keys**: Always use cryptographically secure random number generators.

2. **Key Storage**: Securely store encryption keys, preferably in dedicated key management systems or hardware security modules.

3. **Key Rotation**: Implement regular key rotation practices.

### Implementation Security

Secure implementation requires careful attention:

1. **Side-Channel Protection**: Consider side-channel attacks in your implementation, such as timing attacks.

2. **Memory Handling**: Securely clear sensitive data (like keys) from memory after use.

3. **Constant-Time Operations**: Critical operations should be implemented in a constant-time manner.

## Error Handling

Be prepared to handle these common errors:

```python
try:
    cipher = HydraCipher(key)
    ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(plaintext)
    decrypted = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext)
except ValueError as e:
    # Handle errors like invalid key size, invalid block size, or padding errors
    print(f"Encryption/decryption error: {e}")
```

## Testing

Verify your implementation with test vectors (found in the `tests/vectors` directory):

```python
import json

# Load test vectors
with open('tests/vectors/test_vectors.json', 'r') as f:
    test_vectors = json.load(f)

# Verify implementation
for vector in test_vectors:
    key = bytes.fromhex(vector['key'])
    plaintext = bytes.fromhex(vector['plaintext'])
    expected_ciphertext = bytes.fromhex(vector['ciphertext'])
    
    cipher = HydraCipher(key)
    ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(plaintext)
    
    assert ciphertext == expected_ciphertext, "Implementation did not match test vector"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Invalid Padding**: If you encounter padding errors during decryption, the ciphertext might be corrupted or modified.

2. **Performance Issues**: The algorithm is computationally intensive. For better performance, consider processing data in parallel when appropriate.

3. **Memory Constraints**: The algorithm requires more memory than lightweight encryption algorithms. Consider chunk-based processing for memory-constrained environments.
