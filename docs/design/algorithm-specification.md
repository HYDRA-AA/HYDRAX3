# HYDRA Encryption Algorithm Specification

## Overview

HYDRA is a novel symmetric encryption algorithm designed to provide high security against both classical and quantum attacks. It employs a hyperdimensional state structure and multi-domain protection to create a robust and resilient encryption system.

## Design Goals

1. **Quantum Resistance**: Resist attacks from quantum computers
2. **Multi-Domain Security**: Combine multiple security approaches that operate in different mathematical domains
3. **Adaptive Security**: Adjust security operations based on data characteristics
4. **Performance Efficiency**: Balance security with practical performance requirements
5. **Implementation Simplicity**: Create a design that can be correctly implemented across platforms

## Algorithm Structure

### State Representation

HYDRA uses a 512-bit state arranged in a 4-dimensional hypercube structure:

- 4D hypercube with dimensions of 2⁴ × 2⁴ × 2⁴ × 2⁴ bits
- This structure enables complex permutation and diffusion operations across multiple dimensions
- Coordinates within the hypercube are represented as (w, x, y, z)

### Key Schedule

- Supports key sizes of 256 or 512 bits
- Uses fractal expansion to generate round keys
- Incorporates key-dependent permutations

### Core Operations

#### 1. Dimensional Rotation (D-Rot)

Rotates elements along a specific dimension of the hypercube:

```
D-Rot(state, dimension, rotation_amount):
    For each slice perpendicular to the dimension:
        Rotate the slice by rotation_amount bits
```

#### 2. Multi-scale Substitution (MS-Box)

Context-sensitive substitution layer:

```
MS-Box(state):
    For each 8-bit element at position (w,x,y,z):
        context = calculate_context(state, w, x, y, z)
        box_index = context % num_boxes
        state[w,x,y,z] = S_boxes[box_index][state[w,x,y,z]]
```

The context is calculated based on surrounding elements, making substitution dependent on the state.

#### 3. Fractal Diffusion (F-Diff)

Mixes data using patterns derived from discrete fractal mathematics:

```
F-Diff(state):
    Calculate fractal coordinates for each position
    Mix data according to fractal-derived patterns
    Ensure complete state diffusion in minimal operations
```

#### 4. Adaptive Permutation (A-Perm)

Permutes data based on both key values and data content:

```
A-Perm(state, round_key):
    Calculate permutation patterns based on state characteristics
    Apply permutation patterns derived from both state and round_key
```

### Round Structure

A full encryption round consists of:

1. Dimensional Rotation across each of the 4 dimensions
2. Multi-scale Substitution
3. Fractal Diffusion
4. Adaptive Permutation

The number of rounds varies based on data characteristics:
- Minimum: 16 rounds
- Maximum: 24 rounds
- Additional rounds triggered by data complexity metrics

### Encryption Process

```
HydraEncrypt(plaintext, key):
    state = initialize_state(plaintext)
    round_keys = key_schedule(key)
    
    # Initial whitening
    state = state ⊕ round_keys[0]
    
    # Main rounds
    for i = 1 to base_rounds:
        state = D-Rot(state, i % 4, rotation_amounts[i])
        state = MS-Box(state)
        state = F-Diff(state)
        state = A-Perm(state, round_keys[i])
        state = state ⊕ round_keys[i]
    
    # Adaptive rounds if needed
    complexity = measure_complexity(state)
    additional_rounds = calculate_additional_rounds(complexity)
    
    for i = base_rounds to base_rounds + additional_rounds:
        state = D-Rot(state, i % 4, rotation_amounts[i])
        state = MS-Box(state)
        state = F-Diff(state)
        state = A-Perm(state, round_keys[i % num_round_keys])
        state = state ⊕ round_keys[i % num_round_keys]
    
    # Final transformation
    state = final_transformation(state)
    
    return state
```

### Decryption Process

Decryption follows the same process as encryption but with:
- Inverse operations applied in reverse order
- Round keys applied in reverse order
- The same adaptive round counting must be used

## Security Considerations

### Resistance to Classical Attacks

- **Differential Cryptanalysis**: Protected by adaptive permutations and context-sensitive substitutions
- **Linear Cryptanalysis**: Mitigated by multi-scale diffusion operations
- **Side-Channel Attacks**: Implementation guidelines include constant-time operations

### Quantum Attack Resistance

- **Grover's Algorithm**: 512-bit state provides 256-bit security level against quantum attacks
- **Memory-Hard Operations**: Designed to constrain quantum implementation
- **Sequential Dependencies**: Creates operations that resist quantum parallelization

## Performance Characteristics

- **Software Performance**: Optimized for modern 64-bit processors
- **Hardware Implementation**: Suitable for hardware implementation with parallel processing
- **Memory Usage**: Requires approximately 256 bytes of state memory plus key schedule

## Test Vectors

Test vectors are provided separately in the `tests/vectors` directory.

## Formal Security Proofs

Formal security proofs and further cryptanalysis are in development and will be provided in separate documentation.
