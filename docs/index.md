# HYDRA Encryption Algorithm Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the HYDRA encryption algorithm, a novel symmetric encryption system designed to provide high security against both classical and quantum threats.

## What is HYDRA?

HYDRA is an experimental encryption algorithm that employs a multi-domain protection approach, combining various security techniques to create a robust encryption system:

- 4D hypercube state structure for complex diffusion patterns
- Adaptive round functions that adjust based on data characteristics
- Context-sensitive substitutions that vary based on data content
- Fractal diffusion patterns for thorough mixing

## Important Security Notice

**HYDRA is currently experimental and has not undergone sufficient cryptanalysis to be considered secure for production use.** Do not use this for sensitive data until the algorithm has received extensive review from the cryptographic community.

## Documentation Sections

- [Algorithm Design](design/algorithm-specification.md) - Detailed specification of the HYDRA algorithm
- [Security Analysis](security/security-analysis.md) - Analysis of security properties and potential vulnerabilities
