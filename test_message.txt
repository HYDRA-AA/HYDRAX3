This is a test message for the HYDRA encryption algorithm.

HYDRA is a novel encryption algorithm designed to provide high security against both classical and quantum threats.

It employs a 4D hypercube state structure, adaptive round functions, and multi-domain protection mechanisms.

This test file will be encrypted and then decrypted to verify that the algorithm works correctly.
